# SimCenter Aerodynamic Database

Contains a python script for preparing, searching and post-processing aerodynamic database for buildings. The database holds pressure time-series measured at points(taps) distributed over the building surface. The aerodynamic data set can be: 

- **Experimetal** measurment
- **CFD** simulation for efficient matrix factorization 
- Full-scale **feild** measurment
